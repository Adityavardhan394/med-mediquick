## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with microphone support
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- Internet connection for CDN resources

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `medicines.html` in your browser
3. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
4. The voice assistant is ready to use!

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python medical_ai_backend.py
```

### Integration with Frontend
Update the JavaScript to use the backend API:
```javascript
// In medicines.html, update the processQuery method
async processQuery(transcript) {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/medical-query', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query: transcript })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  this.displayResponse(data.response);
}
```
